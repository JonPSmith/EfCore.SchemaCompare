# Release notes

## 9.0.0

## 8.2.0

- The ExtraInDatabase errors didn't correctly say what part of the database (e.g. "Table", "Column") was extra. This is fixed. 
- NOTE: If you have ignored some ExtraInDatabase errors you our old ignored ExtraInDatabase might need updating to the new (correct format) pattern.
